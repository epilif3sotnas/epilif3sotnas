### About Me

I'm currently ending Electrical and Computer Engineering degree and also working at CEiiA as Electronics and Embedded Systems Engineer.

I start to be curious about technology at high school, then after a research I decide to apply for degrees on this field and after all I end up studying Electrical and Computer Engineering. There I discover fields of Software Development, Computer Networks and Web Development, that I enjoy learn. Besides of this fields outside of University I also discover Financial Technology (FinTech) and blockchain technologies. And now I'm learning more and more FinTech and Blockchain tech.

About my personality I'm described as a constant learner, friendly, focus, resilient, good teammate and willing to work in ideas that improve our life as human beings.
