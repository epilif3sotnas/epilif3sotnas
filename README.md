## About Me

Electronics and Embedded Systems Engineer @ [CEiiA](https://www.ceiia.com) | Electrical and Computer Engineering Master's Student @ [UTAD](https://www.utad.pt)

I start to be curious about technology at high school, then after a research I decide to apply for degrees in this field and end up studying Electrical and Computer Engineering. There, I was fascinated about Software Development, Computer Networks and Web Development. Besides of this interests, outside of University I also discover and learn about Financial Technology (FinTech) and blockchain technologies.

Currently, I am interested in FinTech as well as exploring blockchain on various fields like finance, IoT, assets ownership (e.g. real estate) and government (e.g. e-voting).

Despite of describing only fields that are related with my professional career, there are some that I like to do outside that, like reading, exercising (callisthenics, yoga, boxing) and playing chess.

About my personality I'm described as a constant learner, friendly, focus, resilient, good teammate and willing to work in ideas that improve our life as human beings.
