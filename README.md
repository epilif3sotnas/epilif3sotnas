## About Me

Software Engineer @ [Feedzai](https://www.feedzai.com)

Curiosity for technology sparked during my high school years, leading me to pursue a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering. At university, I developed a strong passion for Software Development, Computer Networks, and Web Development. Outside the classroom, I explored the world of Financial Technology (FinTech) and Blockchain, which have since become my main areas of interest.

Currently, I am focused on the intersection of banking, blockchain, and technology-driven financial solutions. I enjoy learning about and working with innovative tools that are shaping the future of finance.

Beyond my professional interests, I enjoy reading, exercising, and playing chess, which help me stay balanced and sharp.

I see myself as a constant learner-friendly, focused, resilient, and a consistent team player. My ultimate goal is to contribute to ideas and projects that make a positive impact on peopleâ€™s lives.

I am always open to connecting with like-minded professionals and exploring new opportunities in FinTech and Blockchain.
